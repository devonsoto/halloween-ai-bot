# Spooky ChatGPT

## Description

SpookyChatGPT is a Halloween-themed web application designed to engage users with a series of fun and spooky interactive experiences. The application leverages the OpenAI API to generate dares, scares, and mysterious encounters that users can enjoy during their Halloween festivities, especially in a social setting. This was my Halloween costume. I generated a QR code and taped it on my t-shirt so my Halloween could be interactive !
I am not sure how long it will be up for. It was a quick, fun, and cheap costume to do. It just has three buttons that calls OPENAI's api. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. What can I say I got a lot of scans !
